This is my first project in Spring Boot 2.0. 

For display data I used Thymeleaf template engine. 


Service with movies.
Rate movies who you watched.
I implemented algorithm Slope One make predictions for you and show which movies you would like to see.

Slope One is a family of algorithms used for collaborative filtering, introduced in a 2005 paper by Daniel Lemire and Anna Maclachlan.
Arguably, it is the simplest form of non-trivial item-based collaborative filtering based on ratings.
Their simplicity makes it especially easy to implement them efficiently while their accuracy is often on par with more complicated and computationally expensive algorithms.
