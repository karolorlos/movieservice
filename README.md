<h2> Service with movies.
Rate movies who you watched.
I implemented algorithm Slope One make predictions for you and show which movies you would like to see. </h2>

Slope One is a family of algorithms used for collaborative filtering, introduced in a 2005 paper by Daniel Lemire and Anna Maclachlan.
Arguably, it is the simplest form of non-trivial item-based collaborative filtering based on ratings.
Their simplicity makes it especially easy to implement them efficiently while their accuracy is often on par with more complicated and computationally expensive algorithms.

For display data I used Thymeleaf template engine.
